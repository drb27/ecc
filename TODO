1. Longstring generation in defgen (only non-flags are supported)
   	      - String generation
	      - Function prototype generation
	      - Function generation

2. Add error for flag attribute and longstrings combined (not supported)
3. Where longstring is not specified, default to using the short string. 
   Implement this in generated code rather than suplicating strings as symbols
